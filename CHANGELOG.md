# 0.1.x

## Requirements:

* [CosmicLib](https://github.com/CosmicDan-Minecraft/CosmicLib/releases/) 0.3.2 or later
* Forge 1.12.2-14.23.2.2611 or later

## Changes:

### 0.1.0

- Adds Rich-versions of ore for all detected ore blocks (scans the ore dictionary for entries beginning with "ore")
- Rich ore will drop multiple versions of their base ore when broken (the multiple amount is configurable, default x10)
- Rich ore hardness is a multiple of the base ore hardness (also configurable)
- Preferred Mod ID's can be configured, so particular-mod ores will be the rich ore base (I.e. what they will look like and drop)
- No world generation. Use COFH or something else yourself.
- All configuration made possible in Forge GUI 

### 0.1.1

* Compiled against latest CosmicLib 0.3.2
* Add readme
